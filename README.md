# PyBer_Analysis
## Module 5

## Overview of the analysis:
PyBer, a ride sharing service cab company provided data based on city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban) for analysis.  After careful examination, clean and manipulation PyBer is hoping to get a clear picture in order to make an informed decision regarding Accessibility and Affordability as shown below.

## Results: Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

After the initial analysis using multiple graphic representations of ride number vs driver number and fare cost, calculated relationship representing the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is summarized in the table below.

While at 1.6 rides per driver yields a $34.62/ride and $55.49/driver for Rural cities are the lowest amount of rides but paying the highest amount per ride and per driver. With 0.68 rides per driver yields a $24.53/ride and $16.57/driver, Urban cities are the most affordable ride cost but also where the highest demand exists and highest gross amount value.  The Urban cities total fares of $39,854.38 is much higher than the rural setting cities of only $4,327.93.  The suburban city costs and demand fall in between the urban and rural cities.

A graphical representation of the total weekly fares by city type over the period of January through the end of April can be seen below

It can be seen that the amount of weekly fares stays steady throughout the 4 months and stay steady within their Fare bracket. It would be interesting to expand the graph for the whole year in order to see if there is any seasonal change in supply/demand.   

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
At twice the amount of the total fares,  urban cities make more money than suburban cities and had 2.6 times more rides than the suburban cities.  This seems to indicate that there might be less demand for rides in the suburban setting but people there can still afford the average fare per ride being slightly elevated and drivers can make more as well with less competition. However, with an approximate amount of 9 times less total fares in the urban setting in comparison to urban cities, and 30 times less drivers inflating the cost of fare per driver by 3.3 times and driving the cost per ride by 1.4 times more than the urban setting, urban cities seem at a disadvantage.  It would be interesting to look at average income and population numbers to see if the lower total fares and ride numbers are a function of affordability or of a lack of population therefore demand.  The price being so high in rural setting seems to create a disadvantage for people who may need to use ride sharing and at the same time decreasing there demand therefore the job opportunity for drivers as well.  Lastly a population profile base on age demographics may also present a relationship opportunity on demand and affordability.
Recomendations therefore include conduction more in depth data analysis and expand to include population demographics,  based on the demographics consider developing fare brackets for the more needy populations such as seniors and students, and overall lower the ride fares costs to the public in order to promote sales and include work incentives in order to create motivation for more drivers to enter the workforce.
